# üöÄ Astro CSS Bundle

Currently, there is a bug with Astro (or Vite?) that does not inject a link to the stylesheet when `vite.build.cssCodeSplit` is set to `false`. So, this integration does that.

## Installation

```bash
npm i --save-dev @ernxst/astro-bundlecss
```

```bash
yarn add -D @ernxst/astro-bundlecss
```

```bash
pnpm i -D @ernxst/astro-bundlecss
```

## Usage

 ```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import bundle from "astro-cssbundle";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [bundle()],
  vite: {
    build: {
      // Must be set to false if `disableSplitting` is set to false
      cssCodeSplit: false,
    }
  }
})
```

## Configuration

- `disableSplitting` - Whether the integration should automatically override the Astro config and set `vite.build.cssCodeSplit` to `false`.
  - If this is set to `false`, you are responsible for doing so. If CSS code
 splitting is not disabled, this integration will only inject a link to
 the first `.css` file found.
  - default: `true`
- `preload` -  Whether to generate a `<link />` tag with `rel="preload"` and then another
 to actually load the stylesheet. Can improve page performance.
  - default: `true`
